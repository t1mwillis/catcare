# Penelope and Javier
How to care for our (indoor) cats

## Food
They like to eat twice a day.
* Morning -- each cat gets 3/4 cup dry food. Dry food is in the closet on the lower shelf.
* Evening -- each cat gets 1/4 can of wet food. Wet food is in the kitchen in the ice box, lower left corner. Javier knows where.
* Any other time -- treats are always welcome. They are near the wet food in the ice box.

## Water
There is a bowl in the bathroom that we try to keep full. Filling it when you feed them is fine.

## Litter Box
There are two litter boxes, one in the bathroom and one in the living room. We clean them once a day, usually in the morning. There are NYT bags in the kitchen in the lower left drawer next to the sink. The scoop is in the bathroom. Scoop the poop and pee, then take it out to the dumpster. The dumpster is down the hall to the left, up the stairs and out the back door on the left. If the litter gets low, there is more litter in the closet next to the dry food.

## Toilet
Javier is very interested in the toilet. We don't leave the toilet seat up to prevent him from drinking toilet water.

## Play
Javier and Penelope will play with each other, but they also love to play with the pink boa and laser pointer. Javier seems to love playing with the plastic seal to milk containers. It will keep him occupied for a long time. If you use the boa, the pointy end (without the pink boa) is sometimes more popular, especially if you can make some strange noises scratching it against surfaces.

## Moods
Penelope might initially hide under the couch, try to ply her with a few treats. Javier is fairly mischevious, especially in the kitchen. If you need a break, feel free to set him on his cat shelf.

## Blinds
During the day we raise the blinds but tuck the string on the opposite side so it doesn't hang down and Javier can't get at it.
